OrCad Capture CIS and Layout Project: Circuit Design and PCB Layout

This project involves the design and layout creation for an electronic circuit using OrCad Capture CIS and Layout extension. The project is divided into two main phases to create a comprehensive circuit and its corresponding PCB layout.
Overview

The project focuses on creating a detailed circuit design using OrCad Capture CIS. It involves assembling all the components, assigning real-life parts, and ensuring accuracy through error checks and verification. Following the successful circuit design, the Layout extension is used to create a multi-layer PCB layout.
Project Phases
Phase 1: Circuit Design in OrCad Capture CIS

In this phase:

    Assemble and connect all components required for the circuit design.
    Assign real-life parts to each component.
    Error checking is performed; a detailed document is generated to verify errors.
    Validation ensures zero errors before proceeding further.
    Generate a complete parts document necessary for real-life circuit assembly.

Phase 2: PCB Layout using OrCad Layout Extension

In this phase:

    Implement a multi-layer Design for the PCB layout.
    The main layer (top) accommodates all installed components, including thru-hole and PCB components.
    Thru-hole components utilize two separate layers for power supply and ground connections.
    Different power sources such as 12Vi and 5Vi, along with various ground types, are employed to cater to diverse component requirements.
    Routing of components is performed, connecting them to their respective power sources.
    Electrical testing and validation are conducted, including signature verification.
    Upon successful validation, the design is ready for submission to manufacturing.

Main Components

The circuit primarily comprises the following key components:

    Attiny2313 Microcontroller
    Max485: Low-power transceiver for RS-485 and RS-422 communication.
    LM78: Three-terminal positive voltage regulator.
    Other components contributing to the overall system functionality.

Usage

The OrCad Capture CIS and Layout projects are utilized as follows:

    OrCad Capture CIS:
        Assemble components, assign real-life parts, and verify the circuit design through error checks.
        Ensure a zero-error validation process before generating the parts document for real-life circuit assembly.

    OrCad Layout Extension:
        Create a multi-layer PCB layout accommodating different component types and their power requirements.
        Perform routing, power connections, electrical testing, and validation.
